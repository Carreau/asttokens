class IntervalTree:
  """
    The intervalTree is storing nested, consecutive interval in order to quickly
    query a location for the preceding/following opening or closing parenthesis.

    It only stores the index of the tokens that are []{} or ().

    Leaves nodes are always completely included in their parents.
    for example the following sequence, excluding non brackets.

    Note that is is not the generic interval tree, as child nodes are strictly
    included in their parents, and no two child overlap.

    Plus for efficiency and simplicity the child are dense, that is to say the
    c1.high == c2.low-1.


    We have 3 types of nodes:
    - The root â€“ it has children, but an interval query should not extend to
      boundary.
    - IntervalTree node, represent a Pair of balanced bracket.
       - If the query contain a boundary, we extend the interval to the full
         node length and return.
       - If not, we recurse in children.
         - either both end of the query are included in a child
         - both ends are in different child.
    - EmptyNode nodes (leaves), are range of tokens that don't contain imbalanced
      brackets. When hitting those we don't need to extend the range.
      We _can_ have a tree without those nodes, but it ends up being more
      complicated and slower with the extra logic. Here we can just bisect
      children and recurse no matter what.
